highlight NonText guifg=yellow guibg=blue
    " ^ Change the colors for the nontext listchars I configured above (extends & precedes)
    "   To view the current highlight groups and their set colors use:
    "       :so $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/hitest.vim   inside vim

highlight EndOfBuffer guifg=grey guibg=black
    " ^ To set the color of the:  '~'  at the end of the file (only supported in vim 8+)






set guifont=Consolas:h10
    " ^ Set a sensible windows 10 font and font size

autocmd GUIEnter * simalt ~X
    " ^ Start vim with window maximized, default size is too small

autocmd GUIEnter * set vb t_vb=
    " ^ Disable annoying noises from vim
    "   Documented here: https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Disable_beeping

set guioptions+=a
    " ^ Text marked will be automatically copied to the clipboard
    "   This includes every method - mark with the mouse, 'v' for visual selection, etc

" Make shift-insert work like in Xterm:
map <S-Insert> <MiddleMouse>
map! <S-Insert> <MiddleMouse>




" The following settings are specific to windows.
" Use the commands:
"   :echo $HOME
"   :echo $VIM
"   :echo $MYVIMRC
"       to show the respective paths.

" The next set of commands tidy up the default files/dirs so that vim-style files
" don't get left all over the place:

set backupdir=c:/temp/vimtemp//
    " ^ Put the backup file in a sensible directory
    "   This dir needs to exist though!
    "   The // at the end means that the directory information will be saved in the filename
    "   so the backup info for /work/myfile.txt will be stored in /tmp/work/myfile.txt

set directory=c:/temp/vimtemp//
    " ^ Put the swap file in a sensible directory

"set undodir=c:/temp/vimtemp//
    " ^ Put the persistent undo file in a sensible directory
    "   Actually we're not using this option because in the next command we're
    "   disabling persistent undo completely.

set noundofile
    " ^ Disable persistent undo

set viminfo='1000,nc:\\temp\\vimtemp\\_viminfo
    " ^ Put the viminfo file in a sensible directory


" Other useful settings I've found but don't use regularly:
" set ff=unix       " Sets the new line format (cr /crlf)
" set filetype=on   " By default it's on - type  :filetype  to view current setting
